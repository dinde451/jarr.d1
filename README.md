# Jarulf’s Guide to Diablo and Hellfire

This is a copy of Jarulf’s Guide to Diablo and Hellfire, originally released in the
1990s by Pedro Faria / Jarulf. 

This copy is used by the [freeablo project](https://freeablo.org) as a reference, and has been modified from
Jarulf's originals.

If you want to view the guide, go [here](https://wheybags.gitlab.io/jarulfs-guide).
